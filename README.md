# Hello World

## About Me
This is the github account of Alex Tarr. I am a lecturer in Digital Cultures at Newcastle University in [Media, Culture and Heritage](https://www.ncl.ac.uk/sacs/mch/) in the School of Arts and Cultures. 

### What I Do
*coming soon*

## About This Account
I mostly use this account for teaching purposes, though increasingly will add my research here as well. 
This is a polite way of saying ** warning: many of the repos here are partial, works in progress or meant to accompany a lecture/workshop elsewhere **. Anyone is welcome to explore or clone or re-use as they see fit, but they all come with that disclaimer.
